#Approach 1
def doubleL(n): # Define a function doubleL(n) that takes an integer n as inout
    res = [] # Initialize an empty list called res
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2) # Iterate over the ranges from 0 - n-1, for each iteration multiply i by 2 and append to list res
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): # Iterate over the function doubleL 5 times
    print(i, end=' : ') # Print each element followed by a colon
print("\n"+"-"*20)

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]: # Use list comprehension to generate a list of doubled values, for each int in the range from 0-4
    print(x, end=' : ')             # it creates a list where each element n in the nrage is multiplied by 2. Then iterate over each element x
print("\n"+"-"*20)                  # in the list and prints x followed by a colon
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n): # Define a function called double6(n) which takes an integer
        for i in range(n): # create a loop which iterates over 0 to n-1
            yield i * 2 # For each iteration we return i * 2 

for i in doubleG(5): # Iterate over the function double6() 5 times
        print(i, end=' : ') # Print each element followed by a colon
